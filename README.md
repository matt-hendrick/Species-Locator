# Species Locator

[Species Locator](https://specieslocator.web.app) is a website that allows users to search for observations of species of animals, plants, and fungi worldwide. Species observations are pulled from the [iNaturalist API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs). The site uses the Google Maps Places API, the Google Maps Geocoding API, and the iNaturalist API to display a Leaflet heatmap and information on recent observations of a species in the selected location.

Species Locator was built with TypeScript, React 17.0.1, Redux 4.0.5, and Leaflet 1.7.1.
